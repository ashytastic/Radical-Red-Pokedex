Once Gastrodon is full on Stockpile, the Slug can even take some grass type attacks.
Even without Sp.Atk investment, Gastrodon still hits quite well, allowing it to two/three hit KO a lot of Pokémon, while threatening to status the ones it cannot take out fast. Scald lets it burn some threats it might not be able to defeat otherwise, Earth Power will drop Sp.Def to make sure even another wall isn't safe, Sludge Wave lets you spread poison while dealing damage and Clear Smog stops any attempt of a setup sweeper, that isn't a Steel type.

While 95 base attack isn't very high by modern standards Poliwrath makes up for it via very powerful attacks such as Surging Strikes and Close Combat. Jet Punch is also an extremely helpful offensive tool doing very solid damage with priority. Drain Punch also keeps Poliwrath healthy and synergizes excellently with Assault Vest. Ice Punch is a very solid coverage option to hit Dragons or Flying / Grass types in a pinch, and Flip Turn is an excellent tempo tool. Depending on your team composition Poliwrath can utilize a very useful water immunity in Water Absorb, or the powerful rain abusing Swift Swim to highten its offensive potential further.

Avalugg's sky high base 184 defense paired with a decent base 95 hp stat means that even physically offensive monsters like Mega-Lucario aren't able to knock it down after you set up a couple of Iron Defenses, essentially winning you the fight on the spot.

Unlike some other body press users Avalugg isnt completely helpless against Ghosts since its 4th slot can be used for coverage and even when uninvested that base 117 attack stat is nothing to scoff at.

The only threats to this build are special attackers given Avalugg's pitiful special defense, critical hits although to a lesser degree since you still have naturally high defense, and Unaware pokemon that can outstall you quite easily.

Most notably, being able to sit in front of Blue's Xerneas, Eternatus, and Walking Wake, Agatha's Yveltal, Lance's Arceus-Fairy, and Lorelei's Tapu Fini and Kyurem White.

Optionally, you could go Drain Punch over Ice Punch to regain some health, but this leaves you vulnerable to the likes of Mega Rayquaza, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. You can use Iron Hands to pick up a few extra kills if you have a strategy to deal with those three.

	comment = This is a very straightforward sweeping set. Similar to what you might use on Weavile or G-Darmanitan-Zen. A fast and powerful Ice-type is absolutely great against the E4, with the secondary typing deciding what other mons it can destroy besides a lot of what Lance would use, for example. As Chien Pao's a Dark-type, you have more coverage against Agatha's team. With its high Speed, it can outspeed most of the fastest mons the E4 has, only being outspeed by mons like Calyrex, Swift Swim Megs Swampert, and Primal Eternatus. You will mostly use Icicle Crash. Without doing calcs and just going by the move itself and the ability, which lowers the Defense of active mons that don't have Sword of Ruin by 25%, you are doing serious damage. Its SpDef isn't good, so you might not me able to take Draining Kiss from unboosted Calyrex. You could Scarf if you want, but it's better to have someone else take on Calyrex, while Chien Pao can at least mess up Yveltal. Chien Pao isn't ideal for Bruno, but for the other E4 members, it's a great mon to have. The moveset includes its best STAB options, coverage with Sacred Sword, and priority. Ice Shard could be for Primal Eternatus, I don't think I ever used Sucker Punch. You could risk taking Draco Barrage at full HP from Eternatus and retaliate with an OHKO Icicle Crash, but there's a good chance Draco Barrage will OHKO.

In conclusion, if you want a new kind of Weavile to play with, or in general, a new Ice-type sweeper, Chien Pao's highly recommended.

Relaxed Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Body Press  
- Will-O-Wisp  
- Flamethrower  
- Rest
    comment = Turtonator is an extremely useful mon in Hardcore mode. With an excellent defensive typing and access to one of the very few abilities that can increase a stat, Turtonator's 135 base Defense goes extremely far. Body Press will be your most commonly clicked move, as it demolishes most mons it's supereffective against and deals massive chip to anything else. Will-O-Wisp is great both for making your physical bulk even stronger and weakening a threat enough to allow another one of your mons to switch in and take it out safely. Plus, with the move never missing when the user is a fire type, you don't have to worry at all about a pesky 15% miss ruining your strategy. 
    Those two moves are staples of any Turt set, but the remaining two are quite flexible. Generally you'll want to prioritize a Fire STAB, but later in the game, Dragon types become quite common, so a Dragon STAB is occasionally preferred. Its signature move, Shell Trap, has a massive 150 base power and even hits both enemies in double battles, but it does require your opponent to target it with a physical move, which doesn't always happen. If that annoys you, I would run Flamethrower for consistency, but Overheat is also a great option. Since your primary move will be Body Press, you can click Overheat with little downside. Plus, Hardcore mode generally requires a lot of switching, so the penalty is negated even further. You could run both STABs, or even a coverage move like Scorching Sands if you want, but I like Rest as my fourth move. Rest is Turt's only recovery move, but it goes a long way. The most common killers of Turts are poison and frostbite, which Rest can heal. Additionally, this will come at little penalty with your phenomenal Defense stat if the physical mon stays in, or it causes the opponent to switch to a special attacking mon. While your SpDef is a solid 85, the 70 HP means that most special threats will take you out, unfortunately. However, if you properly predict the AI to switch, you can use that as a free opportunity to switch in your counter to it. 
    Long story short, Turt eats physical hits extremely well and supports its team members by burning physical threats and baiting switches. This guy is quite underrated for Hardcore mode, but he has been a crucial part of many of my runs.

Usually when Wobb is on the field its clicking Counter/Mirror Coat once or twice getting one or two KO's, then it dies. Sometimes an opposing Pokémon will use a setup move, in which case Wobbuffet can encore it then switch out. It can be a valuable bring to some fights throughout the game and is rarely dead weight on a team.

Generally you want to run Liechi Berry, however there is one exeption. On the Koga fight specifically you should run Salac Berry to outspeed Mega Toxtricity. If Hitmonlee isn't able to sweep entire fights then it usually still kills multiple Pokémon. 

To set up the sweep, you want to use endure, then get knocked down to 1 HP. This will activate your berry, in turn activating your Unburden ability, and it will make your Reversals have 200 base power. This allows you to outspeed and OHKO so much of the game, and is available right before Koga.

Giving it a Choice Scarf let's it outspeed most of the Elite 4 while as giving it a focus sash let's you freely switch up moves and always get a spike up.

Running Dragon Tail with a Focus Sash allows it to phase out Pokemon that setup in front of it while still being able to survive a hit while the sash is intact.

Finally, Aqua Jet or Sucker Punch can be utilized as a last ditch effort to chip your opponent before Samurott is taken out.

Adamant Nature
- Rock Blast
- Pounce
- Bulldoze
- Stone Axe
    comment = Kleavor was a very solid mon in HC Mode because of its typing and incredible Technician ability, though Sharpness (Blademaster pre 4.0) is another great ability. Thanks to the buff to Stone Axe and Ceaseless Edge being allowed in HC Mode, where hazards are set up (Stealth Rock from Stone Axe, Spikes from Ceaseless Edge), Kleavor's up a few notches. For me, Kleavor requires a lot of moveset changing, hence all the moves listed. Focusing on the E4, I set up Stone Axe on the last 3 E4 battles. You might be able to pull it off in the Lorelei and Bruno battles, but I consistently got it off in the last 3 battles. Rock Blast might not even be necessary, which does allow for more customization (Rock Blast is a tutor move and can't be relearned between E4 battles). I prefer Technician, so all the offensive moves, except for Stone Axe, capitalize on it. Defog is necessary to remove Infernape's Stealth Rock in the Bruno battle. This means Kleavor leads. I had it lead in all but the Lorelei battle. 

Against Agatha, Krook went for Stone Edge after the White Herb proc. Agatha's basically the best trainer to set up rocks on. Pounce is boosted by Technician and can lower Speed. You can lead with that and then KO Krookodile with Stone Axe, you may have to use Defog between those 2 hits. As for Lance, I was reckless and led with Kleavor to set up rocks and hopefully mess with Arceus-Fairy. Glimmora makes this a hassle because you WILL proc Toxic Debris. I'm sure there's a better strategy where you can prevent Glimmora's Toxic Debris to proc, and then set up Stealth Rock later at some point. With Kleavor as my lead, it's a 2HKO to Glimmora with Bulldoze and Stone Axe, resulting in 2 layers of Toxic Spikes. Kleavor has the Sash for Lance and Blue. This requires the AI to make the beneficial 50/50 choice for Arceus-Fairy. It often goes for Dialga unfortunately. The idea is Arceus would set up Calm Mind since Kleavor has the Sash and the AI's greedy when it comes to Sturdy and Sash users. After the Calm Mind, you can use Rock Blast once or twice and KO with Accelerock, hoping Arceus goes for a 2nd Calm Mind. Dialga always comes out after Arceus-Fairy's KO'd. This can allow you some Bulldoze hits and benefit a teammate in outspeeding Dialga.

Against Blue's rain teams, the Sash stays. You take Liquidation, retaliate with Pounce, and then set up with Stone Axe. Kyogre survives unfortunately, but it should be at around or even below 30% after those hits. A teammate can finish that beast off. Against Blue's sun team, the Sash is still there, and it really depends on the AI's choices. Defog and Bulldoze would have to be in the set, no Pounce. You could use Bulldoze, Defog, but one thing you will almost always use is Stone Axe. The sun team hates Stealth Rock the most, so while leading Kleavor against the rain teams is madness, especially if you want the Sash on someone else, in the sun team, I think it's more invaluable. 

In general, version 4.0 puts a lot more importance on Kleavor and H-Samurott, use them once and you might appreciate how helpful they are in this new era of Radical Red.

Because Wish heals 50% of the user's HP stat, it can use Wish, switch out, and heal the incoming Pokémon for a large portion of their HP. This makes it a good support Pokémon on some teams.
Apart from HP, Wigglytuff is very mediocre stat-wise. However, it has a good ability in Sheer Force, and many moves boosted by it. It has good STABs in Tri Attack and Moonblast along with tons of coverage.

Ability: Unburden
Adamant Nature
- Gunk Shot
- Double-Edge
- V-create
- Low Kick
    comment = Grafaiai can now learn Sketch, and despite only being able to learn one, Grafaiai has quickly moved to the top of the versaitility ranking. Grafaiai, unlike Smeargle, has a decent Speed Stat and enough attack to dish out moves like V-Create, Barrage and Fishous Rend. Depending on what your team requires the most, Grafaiai can always be the missing element to your team. 

V-Create is the best move for Grafaiai to hit Steel Types. When combined with a White Herb, it outspeeds everything in the game with Unburden, subsequently allowing it to attack everything else with Double-Edge, Gunk Shot, and Low Kick exclusively for Rock Types.

Draco Barrage allows you to kill all of the Elite 4's powerful dragon types while not having to worry about Fairy's as you're locked into Choice Band.

Fishous Rend and Choice Band paired with it's excellent speed allows you to deal Scarfed Vish like damage. If your team is lacking a water type Fishous Rend could be a go to.

Grafaiai may Flinch, Defense Drop, or Poison it's opponent all at once with Triple Arrows and Poison Touch. If you choose Triple Arrows with Sketch, Low Kick should be substituted with Parting Shot.

    comment = Special Empoleon with Competitive is a powerful force who can do a great deal of damage. It is best used as a mid game wallbreaker that could also pose danger in the late game thanks to its ability to increase its Special Attack when it's stats get dropped, and its covering techniques make sure it can efficiently deal with a variety of opponents. Empoleon is very versatile thanks to this moveset, which concentrates on STAB moves and strong coverage while also offering recovery via Roost. Empoleon receiving Make It Rain in 4.0 makes it even more powerful than previous versions, which relied on Flash Cannon and missed opportunities to OHKO, which it can now achieve.

Jolly Nature
- Flower Trick

- Sucker Punch
- Triple Axel
    comment = Thanks to its excellent speed, solid attack, amazing movepool and the Protean ability, Meowscarada may very well be the best Grass starter that isn’t Mega Sceptile. Protean allows Meowscarada to be an incredibly versatile attacker that can switch its type to give STAB on any of its attacking moves, while also changing out what would have been one of its weaknesses into a neutral or even resisted type. While expecting Meowscarada to sweep entire boss battles is unrealistic, Meowscarada is absolutely capable of destroying or severely weakening 1-2 key threats in boss battles if used correctly. Life Orb is generally the preferred item to maximize damage without locking into one move and ruining the point of Protean, but there are cases where Sitrus Berry is preferable for survivability. In terms of the Hardcore E4, Meowscarda is capable of destroying Mega Swamperts, Dragonites, Hail Lorelei’s Tapu Fini, Bruno’s Mega Medicham (can also do heavy damage to Necrozma Duskmane), Agatha’s Yveltal (with Triple Axel Life Orb) or Calyrex Shadow (with Choice Scarf), Lance’s Mega Rayquaza (with Triple Axel Life Orb), Champ’s Primal Kyogre, Ultra Necrozma, and Arceus Ground. It is also able to troll Primal Dialga and severely weaken it by switching to Play Rough and then switching back to a Dark type move to make sure it doesn’t get one-shot by Flash Cannon, but if you want to use Meowscarada for this purpose a Sitrus Berry is likely preferable for survivability. Overall, Meowscarda is an incredible offensive mon if used correctly that other Grass starters could only wish they could match.

Ampharos appreciates help from teammates like Rillaboom, Klefki, Grimmsnarl, Porygon2 and Hatterene as they provide Grassy terrain, Dual screens, and trick room support for Ampharos. While setting up with Mega Ampharos is quite difficult, it's immense power makes it worth it.

    comment = At first glance it looks weak, but once you use Fillet Away at the right moment, this Pokemon turns into a sweep machine that can literally destroy any trainer in its path. Boosted cutting moves, critical hits and raising all offensive stats plays a significant role, especially if you can apply fish with Scope Lens, which will destroy even the thickest Pokemon with juicy critical hits (hi, Lance's Dialga). Sticky Web would be a good help for this fish, since there are still Pokemon that can be much faster. You also need to remember that Veluza does not have the best defense stats, though, you can work with them. So it is more recommended to use Sitrus Berry so that you have more chances to survive.

Modest Nature
- Draining Kiss

    comment = Draining Kiss in combination with Triage is one of the most spammable attacks in the entire game. Comfey's utilizes it's low HP stat and its high defensive stats to consistently stay healthy with Draining Kiss' recovery using the priority of Triage to ensure you are always healthy before the opponent attacks. Calm Mind works wonderfully as it can increase the damage of Draining Kiss as well as provide extra survivability. Giga Drain is nice coverage for Water, Ground, and Rock types that also benefits from Triage's priority. Sparkly Swirl is a good for situations when you need to hit harder as well as providing valuable team support by clearing all status ailments on your team. Leech Seed is always a powerful defensive tool to provide valuable chip damage to anything Comfey can't damage very well, or it could utilize Synthesis to ensure it stays healthy. Since Draining Kiss is Comfey's main selling point you want to boost it's power as much as possible. Choice Specs is a very significant boost in power, while Pixie Plate is a good option if you want to keep the rest of your moveset readily available.

    comment = Mega Blastoise is 135 base Sp.Atk, 78 base Speed pokémon that can use Shell Smash to boost it's sweeping capacity much, much more.
But for setting up Shell Smash, you have to survive a hit, in order to do that you're gonna have to set up against a pokémon that's (before the set-up) faster than you, so they hit you before your defenses weaken.
Modest nature, as, after 2x speed, it can even outspeed Deoxys-Speed. Water Pulse is the option for most damage, and scald for the chance of burning physical attacker that may live scald (and also break Focus Sashes).

    paste = Arma (Armaldo) @ Assault Vest
Ability: Skill Link
Adamant Nature
- Pin Missile
- Rock Blast
- Rapid Spin
- Knock Off
  comment = Armaldo is surprisingly one of the best anti-hazard leads out there with Assault Vest. Rock Blast/Pin Missile allows you to break the sash of most of the leads, match up well with almost all the leads in RR, as well as allowing you to hit even resistant switch ins for solid damage.  Rapid Spin ensures that the only way the opposing lead is going to get rocks up is by killing Armaldo, which in turn allows you to get a revenge killer of your own in to ensure no hazards go up. If you win the 1v1, the rapid spin boost allows you to get one last move off. Knock off is great for getting rid of opposing items, potentially allowing a set-up sweeper to take advantage. Aqua Jet is great at getting a bit of poke damage before death if you're still outsped. Bulldoze allows you to lower the speed of the enemy pokemon, allowing your next pokemon to take advantage and finish the opposing pokemon off. Finally, earthquake is great for all around coverage against steel types.

Modest Nature
- Mega Drain

  comment = Roserade is one of the most versatile pokemon in RR. Technician allows normally weak moves like Mega Drain and Ominous Wind to be boosted up to high levels. Mega Drain and Sludge Bomb are high stab moves, but can easily be blocked by steel types. Ominous Wind and Substitute take care of that and removes the prediction portion of Roserade. Not only that, Substitute allows you to fish for Ominous Winds omniboost, which can easily setup a sweep. Ominous Wind allows you to hit those pesky ghost types that try to switch into your poison type moves. If you're against a dragon heavy trainer, Dazzling is a great move for general coverage, or you can setup either Toxic Spikes or regular Spikes for chip if you're worried Roserade might get walled in a fight. Hazards also allow you to remove prediction. Realistically, any decent move is good in the fourth slot, it's up to your creativity!

With the help of mental herb, it can get webs up on Aerodactyl, Infernape, and other unlikely matchups. Not only that, it can also handle scary threats such as Lorelei's rain abusers, and it can even survive a Triple Axel from the champion's Pheromosa if you swap its attack EVs for HP and give it a Sitrus Berry. Obviously, this Pokémon goes well with all kinds of hyper offensive teams, and it's the only Sticky Web setter in grass monotype runs, making it quite valuable there in particular.

Adamant Nature

    comment = The Wooper line is beloved amongst many in the RR Discord, and Clodsire proves itself worthy to be a member of that august lineage. It may seem like a terrible Pokémon when looking at its 430 BST, but in truth this mon is an underrated beast who is able to pull its weight against even the Hardcore E4. Clodsire is, without a doubt, THE hardest counter to Xerneas and Arceus Fairy in the entire game. Thanks to Unaware, Clodsire absolutely does NOT care in the slightest about Geomancy or Calm Mind, and all they can do is feebly attack it with moves that barely do a quarter of its health at most, while Clodsire laughs in their faces and whacks them to death with Poison Jab. Not only that, but if you ended up getting Toxic Spikes set up on you by Lance’s Glimmora, Clodsire absorbs those pesky spikes no problem. Equally importantly, it is a Counter mon that opponents CANNOT set up on, and without setup most mons won’t be able to one-shot Clodsire unless it’s from something like a Mega Rayquaza or Ultra Necrozma. It gets the freest Counter kill ever on Bruno’s Zacian because of this, and with a Payapa Berry it can bait a Pyro Ball instead of an Expanding Force from Agatha’s Victini, getting another Counter kill on it (which is important because Clodsire has a poor matchup against Agatha otherwise). Clodsire’s only truly poor matchup in the Hardcore E4 is against Lorelei, but with a Yache/Passho Berry it should be able to survive long enough to contribute to at least one kill. To those who look past its derpy exterior, Clodsire is a hidden gem of potential who can provide valuable contributions that should not be underestimated.

One last note: Impish is NOT recommended as a nature since it anti-synergizes with Counter.

  comment = Meganium's Triage ability makes it seem like it could be a decent offensive weapon, but the two main uses of it (Draining Kiss, Giga Drain) either don't do enough damage to be threatening or are easily walled, and the 83 SpA certainly doesn't help. Meganium truly florishes when you use it as a supportive screen setter. Its natural bulk and fairy typing allows easy screen setting and pivots. Earthquake is great for hitting those steel types that always seem to switch in to stop meganium, brandishing a very average but useable 82 attack stat that will slowly chip away at steels. Otherwise, using toxic on pokemon who plan on using a set-up move before using screens ensures that the enemy are put on a timer. Meganium is best used as an annoying support pokemon, instead of a triage sweeper.

  comment = Offensive Donphan is one of the most devastating non legendary pokemon that you have access too. With Technician boosted Bonemerang, anything neutral to ground takes tons of damage, and one shotting almost anything weak to ground. With a wide array of rock moves, you can pick your poison. Rock Tomb has 100 accuracy and is technician boosted while lowering speed, Stone Edge is higher damage for less accuracy, and Head Smash can destroy anything that switches in, sacrificing health. Knock Off is never a bad move, and while it's not technician boosted, knocking off enemy items will never be bad. Finally, Technician Ice Shard can do a surprising amount of damage, while also giving Donphan a priority move for all the dragons/flying types that try to switch into Donphan's Bonemerang. Donphan's coverage allows it to ensure ground immune pokemon are unable to switch into his moves. This pokemon has tools that make it so almost no pokemon can switch into it without taking massive damage.

Against the other Elite 4 members Greedent comes alive against Primal Groundon/ Mega Swampert(Gary)/ Arceus(Normal)/ Dragonite(Lance)/Melmetal/ Necrozma(Lance). You can pick between Liechi or Sitrus depending on if you wanna hit Ghost Types with EQ or have a stab move in Tail Slap. But go Chople against Bruno as it literally stops his Infernape lead from killing you with one CC, and allows you to setup a free Stuff Cheeks, and sweep his team (except for Iron Valiant which can be a threat cause +6 def with BP has a 44.9% to 2 KO) Pokémon that this build won't work against is mostly Lorelei and Agatha as they have ways to deal with it, as well as all the Sp.Attackers that have setup as they can easily setup on you and sweep you.

Earthquake is the reliable stab for attacking, Pain Split is here for recovery if you ever get hit to low hp by splitting your opponent's hp. For the third slot it depends on you, Shadow Claw for consistency and general circumstances, Shadow Sneak to finish off any low hp target or sashed target that already broke their sash, lastly Night Shade if you need a consistent damage againts bulky opponents.

His sweeping power is boosted further by his ability Rock Head which means Torterra can freely use high base power recoil moves like Wood Hammer and Head Smash without suffering any recoil. For the ground stab it's your choice, higher base power Headlong Rush for the extra damage but risking the stats drop or the good old reliable Earthquake.

  comment = Chandelure is a very flexible pokemon in RR, able to run both defensive and Offensive sets with a wide move pool. Between Shadow Ball and Flamethrower, you should have plenty of coverage to hit every pokemon that switches in hard with a 145 Special Attacking stat. Shadow Tag is used best when you switch into a pokemon that is either choiced, or is unable to deal much damage with you. Will-o allow you to set up max Calm Minds on physical attackers who lack coverage for Chandelure. Substitute ensures that if you're setting up on a special attacker, once you set up to max and kill him, you'll be firmly behind a sub to guarantee another kill on any opposing switch ins. This Pokemon is not a normal sweeper in RR terms. Shadow Tag Chandelure is at its best when it can set up and pick off weakened enemy teams who are down a couple pokemon, and lack the switch ins to handle the barrage of attacks.

    comment = Mega Charizard Y is known for its power, but in Radical Red it often runs into a problem; being outsped and either KO'd, or brought down too low to be of use again. This is where this set comes in. It should allow you to live hits from things like Mamoswine, Gyarados (thanks to Drought) and other hard hitters. After burning them, you can either wear them down with your natural special attack, or switch out to another team member, preferrably one that takes advantage from the sun. This means Charizard will be able to get in the field and get its weather up a lot more safely, bypassing the hurdle that is not being able to hold a Heat Rock. You can also swap the HP EVs for defense for example, but the extra HP allows it to be a better mixed wall, considering its base special defense and moveset.

  comment = Venusaur is one of the best grass types to use to abuse sun, it has good setup move in Growth, good offensive stats, good speed, and also good coverage moves. Use Solar Beam as your main grass stab if you want damage and use Giga Drain if you prefer recovery. Sludge Bomb is a good reliable poison stab to use but feel free to swap for other coverage if needed. For the third slot you can choose between Earth Power or Weather Ball depends on the matchup, both are great. And your main setup move is Growth as it raises both of your offensive stats by 2 stage if used under sun. Lastly you could swap out your held item anytime too but generally Life Orb is very good, another alternative is Focus Sash to guaranteed a setup or living a hit.

Bouffalant previously had to contend with always suffering recoil with Head Charge as its strongest move however, now that it has Raging Bull, even though it is a weaker attack, Bull Rush offers it strength equal to or almost equal to that of Head Charge.

Spamming Raging Bull has drawbacks including the inability to attack Steel or Ghost types, however these drawbacks can be overcome thanks to access to the amazing Headlong Rush and for the world's Corviknights you also have Wild Charge.

    comment = Many were shocked to learn that Electivire had lost it's part Fighting type which had made it such a dazzling contender for your team but Electivire is still a pretty good pokemon, even if losing it would appear to be such a nerf. Losing the fighting type also means it's now weak to one type again and it's attack was reset to 123 while also gaining Drain Punch which is boosted by Iron Fist.

Now Electivire may act as an offensive pivot thanks to Volt Switch by switching out of bulkier opponents and generating momentum for your team. Electivire should be used mostly as a wallbreaker and revenge killer as it can quickly take care of slower pokemon without breaking a sweat.

It packs a punch, no pun intended. Having Iron Fist and the Elemental Punches combined on top of the new Punching Glove offers you essentially the same damage output as you would have had when Electivire was still part fighting type.

Impish Nature

    comment = While spidops has a pretty low speed and barely decent "bulk", it is a quite unique pokémon, as it is the only one that can set up Sticky Web and Spikes.

The ways to make "use" of this pokémon is:
Using it as a lead, and switching between silk trapping and trying to set up hazards until you can't, then, using memento to lower the opponent pokémon's stats so you can switch in another pokémon, preferably a setup sweeper, that is if your opponent (somehow) can't do much damage to spidops.

In case spidops receives enough damage to be OHKOed (it will happen very frequently), and your focus sash is broken, you should try to get as much Silk Traps as you can, so you can lower their speed enough for you to outspeed.
Circle Throw is  another option instead of memento for switching out bad match-ups and doing damage.

  comment = Realistically, if you're using Typhlosion you're pressing one move, and that's whatever fire stab that you desire out of Flamethrower/Fire Blast/Overheat. (It also learns Eruption at level 100 if you're in postgame] While Typhlosion can run Heavy Duty Boots to ensure it will always have the priority, I prefer to pair Typhlosion with defoggers/rapid spinners to ensure that the priority fire stab can deal as much damage as possible, while also keeping your priority. Running Heavy Duty Boots heavily lowers your damage. Otherwise, both Scorching Sands and Focus Blast are just general coverage you would click if something like bulky fire types/flash fire pokemon switch in. Hidden Power grass is for those specially bulky ground and water types that might switch in. But even then, I'd still recommend clicking your fire stab almost 99% of the time. Paired with hazard control, Typhlosion may not sweep, but it can poke large holes in the enemies team to allow your other pokemon to take advantage.

    comment = Salamence reserves very formidable bulk and utility with its ability Intimidate that allows it to act as a physical wall without losing offensive presence. Its access to Roost allows it to toxic stall bulky opposition while removing its flying weaknesses to make it less apt to ice attacks. 
Salamence uses Flamethrower to reliably hit steel types with its impressive special attack stat and Dual Wingbeat deal active damage when Roost isn’t necessary.
The EV distribution allows Salamence to outspeed certain Pokémon in order to maintain longevity with Roost.
Other options may allow Salamence to become a bulky sweeper by replacing Flamethrower with Earthquake and Toxic with Dragon Dance to give it setup potential against Pokémon who may otherwise out-stall it.

  comment = Hustle Lilligant is one of the biggest boom or busts in RR, but also has the greatest rewards. With a base 105 Atk and Speed stat, just one victory dance can have you outspeeding and oneshotting the enemy; not even including hustles +50% damage output. The main catch, even with Wide Lens, is that you're always one miss away from the sweep being halted. Leaf Blade and Close Combat are both STAB moves that cover a lot of variety of Pokémon, Ice Spinner is great for those flying types and dragon types that decide to try to wall you, and Victory Dance is physical quiver dance. With perseverance and prays to the gods of RNG, this Pokemon is arguably one of the biggest menaces in the mid-early late game area.

    comment = Klinklang makes use of Gear Grind for a potent multi-hit 150BP STAB attack after Steely Spirit to break sturdy, multiscale, and substitute without issue. Its two other moves act as high-powered coverage to deal with opposing steel or water types. Mental Herb gives Klinklang the utility to lead battles with Shift Gear and outspeed its competition in the face of Taunt.
Klinklang’s EV distribution is made specially to allow it to outspeed the meta after one Shift Gear while still leaving enough bulk to survive most priority attacks and some super-effective physical attacks.

    comment =  Maushold becomes a force to be reckoned with as it commands an incredible 300BP STAB attack and an impressive speed tier, even unboosted.
Wide Lens is essential for the move Population Bomb as each hit naturally has a 90% chance of connecting without the item, making the move have a 35% chance of hitting for max damage compared to a 90.4% chance with Wide Lens.
Maushold utilizes its other moves to hit ghost types or types that quad-resist normal type attacks because it otherwise still hits hardest with Population Bomb. Beat Up can be used to deal significant damage to ghost type Pokémon and Low Kick handles the rare Rock / Steel type Pokémon it may face. Bullet Seed may be used to address certain Pokémon that are quad-weak to grass type attacks. Tidy Up allows Maushold to outspeed a significant portion of the meta when it can afford to set up. 
Generally, Maushold only ever needs to click Population Bomb.

Additionally, it can go head-to-head with Steel and Fairy types thanks to a solid physical move pool that includes coverage like Poison Jab and Earthquake.

Hardcore mode prevents Haxorus from doing its due diligence due to its inability to use Swords Dance and Dragon Dance, however, by using a Salac Berry and Endure, you're able to over come this by enabling Haxorus to become an insane late game sweeper.

    comment = Golurk flaunts naturally impressive bulk thanks to its RR buffs which allows it to focus on its sweeping capabilities. Golurk’s excellent defensive typing and high HP stat allows it to make strong use of the move Drain Punch alongside a 43% boost from Iron Fist and Punching Glove to act as passive recovery, both boosting longevity and the power of its move Rage Fist over time.
Golurk’s strongest utility is its ability to boost its speed in front of many threatening Pokémon to produce sweeping potential that is unwavered by most priority attacks.
Headlong Rush, acting as a fist move, provides Golurk with a fresh 171BP STAB attack before it can prepare Rage Fist after sustaining two hits. Drain Punch serves both as strong fighting coverage and its main method of recovery.

    comment = Thanks to its huge HP stat and exceptional longevity with Roost, Dudunsparce is an intimidating status spreader that is hard to defeat. Serene Grace permits Bite to have a 60% chance to flinch, Poison Jab to have a 60% chance to poison, and Body Slam to have a 60% chance to paralyze. If you add leftovers to this combo, opponents who aren't fighting types will find it difficult to take it down.

Due to the necessity for Roost and Body Slam yet inability to hit either a Ghost Type or a Steel Type, Dundunsparce may experience 4 move syndrome. You can insert Body Press or Rock Smash to hit Steel Types according on what your team most requires. Due to the 100% chance of lowering defense by 1 with Rock Smash and the 60% risk of flinching with Bite when dealing with Ghost Types, respectively.

    comment = With its immunity to ground and electric attacks using its incredible defensive typing, I find Pikachu-Flying is the best variant of Pikachu you can find.
Be mindful of the fact that Raichu outclasses Pikachu with Life Orb using the same niche, so there is not much reason to choose Pikachu other than for type immunity or gimmick reasons.
This set makes use of three of Pikachu’s priority attacks to stack damage on its opponent, while hitting Zippy Zap for notable damage. The move Fly allows Pikachu to threaten grass type Pokémon or to force the AI into a swap as its strongest attack.
Other options including Volt Switch or Thunder Wave may allow Pikachu to pivot or act as utility.

    comment = Starmie boasts excellent coverage and speed to provide a well-rounded special attacker augmented by a 96% accurate Hydro Pump as its main offensive force.
Psyshock allows Starmie to provide pressure offensively on both sides to avoid being pressed by special walls. Meteor Beam paired with Power Herb both allows Starmie to hit with powerful rock coverage and also increases its offensive presence by +1 SpAtk. Ice Beam acts as reliable ice coverage compared to Blizzard which may miss at 84% accuracy.

    comment = Mandibuzz exhibits a deceptively remarkable defensive stat spread and typing, making it capable of sustaining many strong attacks on either side.
Mandibuzz usually favors the move Foul Play for presence to make up for its low attack stats. This also works to punish opposing hard-hitters, especially those that increase their attack stat.
Mandibuzz utilizes Toxic to stall out bulkier threats alongside Roost and Knock Off.
Overcoat is Mandibuzz’s best ability as it blocks sandstorm chip damage and powder moves, allowing it to better handle rock type and grass type Pokémon. 
Other options may allow Mandibuzz to have more utility for your team including Whirlwind to pivot your opponent into entry hazards, Taunt, Defog, or Brave Bird for a bit more offensive presence against fighting type Pokémon.

    comment = Armaldo utilizes its impressive bulk and attack stat to produce significant damage to any enemy that doesn’t resist its attacks.
Its EV distribution yields speed to its opponents in exchange for additional bulk and maximum attack as Armaldo will not outspeed many Pokémon anyway.
Armaldo’s Silver Powder allows Armaldo to have a 108BP priority move in First Impression without locking it in like Choice Band would or sacrificing longevity like Life Orb.
Armaldo’s main offense lies in its new priority move First Impression, which serves to ignore its otherwise terrible speed stat and get the upper hand against faster Pokémon, often hitting for a revenge KO.
Its other moves Pin Missile and Rock Blast act alongside Skill Link to produce substantial damage against bulkier Pokémon or to break Sturdy and Multiscale while Earthquake helps against steel type Pokémon.
Other options including Choice Band may allow Armaldo to break more Pokémon it would otherwise fail to OHKO while Assault Vest would allow Armaldo to have substantial bulk on both sides in exchange for some physical presence.

Noctowl makes use of the move Esper Wing to boost its mediocre speed stat into a usable range alongside Calm Mind, which serves to wall special attackers. Noctowl makes use of Feather Dance to significantly reduce the attack power of certain threats which may otherwise defeat it to provide enough longevity to score a KO. 
Its EV distribution is set to allow Noctowl to tank at least one super-effective hard-hitting physical attack, giving it the upper hand against certain threats.

Glaceon utilizes a speed tier that sets it faster than the meta under snow, so benefits from a modest nature to amplify the damage it can deal.
Under snow, Blizzard is Glaceon’s primary attack as it provides excellent damage without concern for accuracy. Freeze-Dry provides Glaceon a reliable answer to water types and serves as ice STAB when not under snow. Earth Power and Shadow Ball contribute to tie up Glaceon’s remaining coverage issues by handling steel type and fire type Pokémon, as well as specific threats such as Bronzong.

    comment = Avalugg makes use of its new ability Filter to become one of the most potent walls in the game as the ability allows it to survive super-effective attacks far more gracefully than before.
Avalugg utilizes both its naturally immense Def stat and its invested SpDef to set up Curse to then recover damage when it gets low, building both its attack and defense further.
Avalugg’s EV distribution allows it to take significant special damage from enemies who may not fall to the first Ice Shard.  
Avalugg’s low speed is easily mitigated by its new access to the move Ice Shard which allows it to strike with priority, often scoring a KO against a much faster foe. Earthquake is used as coverage against fire type and steel type Pokémon who would otherwise resist its ice attack.
Other options may allow Avalugg to use Body Press instead of Earthquake or opt for a fully defensive spread to maximize Body Press damage and physical walling potential.

Ability: Technician  
Tera Type: Bug  
EVs: 248 HP / 28 Def / 232 SpD  
Careful Nature  
- Bullet Punch  
- Rock Smash  
- Swords Dance  
- Roost
    comment = Mega Scizor is best utilized as a bulky sweeper, using its defense and recovery to boost its attack to deliver strong priority attacks with Bullet Punch.
Mega Scizor should be considered over its base form when the team requires a more substantial wall for pivoting and setting up.
Mega Scizor’s EV distribution allows it enough defense to tank attacks from most notable physical attackers while also providing enough special defense to make it bulky on both sides and allow it to stay in on would-be checks.
Bullet Punch serves as Mega Scizor’s primary STAB attack while Rock Smash provides it with a no-risk coverage move against opposing steel type Pokémon. Swords Dance and Roost work simultaneously to augment Mega Scizor’s attack while keeping it healthy to provide its team sweeping potential.
Other options may allow Mega Scizor to be an even bulkier tank with Curse or a stronger wall-breaker with Close Combat. Superpower may be considered for Curse sets as it compromises bulk less significantly than Close Combat.

Heracross Mega
{
    name = 185 base attack seems kinda good
    item = Heracronite
    ability = Skill Link
    nature = Adamant/Jolly
    moves = Pin Missile, Arm Thrust, Rock Blast, Bullet Seed
	paste = Heracross-Mega @ Heracronite
Ability: Skill Link
Jolly Nature
- Arm Thrust
- Pin Missile
- Rock Blast
- Bullet Seed
    comment = Mega Heracross has the 2nd highest attack stat in the game, just behind Mega Mewtwo X. Along with this massive attack stat of 185, it has 125BP STAB moves with no drawbacks. These combined means it has some of the highest damage output in the game with no boosting required. 
Along with the damage output, it has okay bulk. It can usually take about two hits before dieing/switching out.
These two factors make for a very good Pokémon that is useful on many teams.

    nature = Modest

    paste = Golden (Gholdengo) @ Choice Specs
Ability: Good as Gold
Modest Nature
- Make It Rain
- Shadow Ball
- Thunderbolt
- Dazzling Gleam
comment = Gholdengo is one of the most dangerous pokemon in RR, having virtually no pokemon that can safely switch in to its attacks. Not only that, its steel and ghost dual typing is one of the best typings in the game, giving him a multitude of switch in opportunities. With Specs, Stab Make it Rain and Shadow Ball turn into nukes on any pokemon that dares face off against it. Thunderbolt is nice for any water types trying to switch into its steel moves. For your last coverage move, you get to choose whatever fits into the fight. Focus Blast is nice for any steel or normal types trying to switch in on your STAB attacks. Dazzling is nice for any Dragons or Dark types attempting to predict your shadow ball. Finally, Psychic is nice for, again, fighting types trying to switch into your steel move. See what fight lays ahead, and change your last coverage move accordingly!

Golem A

    name = Dynamite
    item = Choice Band
    ability = Galvanize
    nature = Adamant
    moves = Explosion, Double Edge, Superpower, Earthquake
    paste = Dynamite (Golem-Alola) @ Choice Band
Ability: Galvanize
Adamant Nature
- Explosion
- Double Edge
- Superpower
- Earthquake
  comment = Golem-A has one of the single highest damage moves in the game, combining its ability and its item. Explosion is a 150 base power move that halves the opponents defense; which combined with Galvanize turns it into both an electric type move and increases the power by 1.2x, and Choice Band which increases its power by 1.5x. All of this is coming from a base 120 Attacking stat. This, in turn, makes it so almost any non-ground type cannot switch in without getting KO'd. It basically is a fun way to 1 for 1 the opponent. But you don't have to just explode. Double edge, while not as powerful, does a ton of damage to anyone standing in front without sacrificing yourself. Superpower is a nice coverage move for a variety of typings. Finally, Earthquake is a solid coverage move, hitting ground and steel types thinking they can switch in for free extremely hard. This set might not be the best thing in RR, but it is a ton of fun to use!

    moves = Tail Slap, Bullet Seed, Rock Blast, Knock Off/Triple Axel/U-Turn/Encore
    paste = Mouse (Cinccino) @ Loaded Dice
Ability: Technician
Jolly Nature
- Tail Slap
- Bullet Seed
- Rock Blast
- Triple Axel
  comment = Cincinno is one of the best users of Loaded Dice in RR, due to its moveset allowing it numerous multi-hit moves, and technician which powers up these moves to enormous levels. Tail Slap, Bullet Seed, and Rock Blast are all great multi-hit moves that are technician boosted and are generally good coverage. However, Cincinno suffers from "4 move syndrome." It really wants more than 4 moves, so it's up to you which one you choose last for coverage. Triple Axel is amazing, with loaded dice making it so it only has to pass one accuracy check in order to hit all 3 times. Great for the plethora of late game dragons in RR. Knock Off is one of the best moves in Pokemon, you can never go wrong pressing this move. U-Turn is great for momentum due to Cincinno's 115 speed tier outspeeding a ton of threats. Finally, Encore is nice for any pokemon that dares set-up on you. You simply Encore, then switch into a different threat that counters your opponent. Each of these moves are good in different situations, so plan accordingly!

Ability: Fluffy
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Def / 0 SpA / 0 SpD / 0 Spe
Impish Nature
- Bulk Up
- Protect

    comment = Bewear's Alolan heritage gave it the right to bear arms and is it gonna flex those fluffy arms with bulk up. Bewear can take loads of physical damage and dish out even more while Protect let Bewear eat its leftover in between tanking physical attack. Drain punch's sustainability and Shadow Claw for coverage are self explanatory. This set can trivialize most physical threat and even sweep Bruno and Lance after their respective special attackers are taken out.
P/s: Lance and Blue are idiots that prioritize super effective stab on Salamence and Metagross over their fire coverages

	paste = Sceptile-Mega @ Sceptilite  
Ability: Technician  
Jolly Nature  
- Bullet Seed  
- Dual Chop  
- Rock Tomb  
- Bulldoze
	comment = Recognized as one of the most powerful Megas in the entire game, Mega Sceptile boasts excellent physical attack (further boosted by Technician) as well as frankly insane speed. The moves listed give M-Scep excellent coverage and make the most of Technician, with Earthquake vs. Bulldoze depending on whether you want slightly more power or a speed drop. It has excellent matchups against Rain Lorelei, being able to destroy Palkia, Mega Swampert, and damaged Dragonite. It’s less good against Hail Lorelei, but it destroys Tapu Fini with 3+ Bullet Seed and can whack Slush Rush mons with Rock Tomb. Against Bruno, M-Scep beats Zeraora, most mons if they're already decently damaged, or anyone that has suffered a defense drop from their own Close Combat. Against Agatha, it can OHKO Krookodile with 4+ Bullet Seed, has a decent chance of beating Victini with Rock Tomb + Earthquake, and can clean up a weakened Mega Mewtwo X or Yveltal. Against Lance, M-Scep has a practically guaranteed chance to one-shot Mega Rayquaza, can destroy damaged Dragonite, and can hit his other mons decently hard. Where Mega Sceptile REALLY shines is against the Primal Kyogre champ teams. Mega Sceptile is able to utterly DESTROY Primal Kyogre, Mega Swampert, Walking Wake, and Ultra Necrozma, AND it is able to do over ¾ of Eternamax Eternatus’ health with a single Dual Chop. Its only poor matchups are against the Arceus forms and Xerneas, but that’s what your other teammates are for, and being able to potentially solo 4-5 mons single-handedly is an insanely effective performance that most other Pokémon simply can’t replicate. While it can’t deal with every threat in the Hardcore E4, Mega Sceptile remains an insanely powerful Mega, and one that you can only now get in the endgame for a reason.

Ability: Sharpness

Jolly Nature
Leaf Blade/Shadow Claw
Psycho Cut
Sacred Sword
Triple Axel/Cut
	comment = Mega Gallade is back and better than ever, thanks to the introduction of the new Sharpness ability that gives a more consistent 1.5x power boost to cutting moves compared to the old Blademaster. Not only does Mega Gallade pack a lot of power and solid special bulk and speed, but it also has a frankly insane movepool coverage that covers many types, including Grass, Water, Dark, Rock, Steel, Ice (as Triple Axel, no less), Ghost, among others. What’s even better is that many of these moves come with an increased crit chance, meaning that even if you couldn’t kill something in one hit normally, a cheeky crit might get the job done for you and tip you over the edge into a OHKO anyway. Mega Gallade also has Thunder Wave and Encore for supporting options. Encore is revered amongst HC players for being able to troll setup mons, and Thunder Wave ensures that even if Mega Gallade can’t quite secure the kill on something, paralyzing it and leaving it in red health is pretty much as good as killing it anyway. Mega Gallade is capable of taking down many dangerous targets in the HC E4 by itself, but it stands out as one of the best Megas to kill Eternamax Eternatus with. Not only does it have a solid chance of beating Eternamax Eternatus outright, but if it comes in on a damaged one, it’s possible that EE might waste its turns on Recover and let Mega Gallade kill it for free. Overall, Mega Gallade is a highly powerful and versatile Mega that is made even better thanks to the buff to Sharpness.

    comment = Skunktank is objectively not a good Pokémon but its typing yields certain resistances and immunities that some teams may look for, giving it very niche usage.
Skunktank’s buff to SpAtk gives it slightly better performance in its coverage thanks to access to Fire Blast but its greatest asset is its STAB Sucker Punch alongside utility in defog or taunt.
Skuntank runs SpAtk EVs to boost Fire Blast enough to OHKO certain steel type Pokémon.
