Once Gastrodon is full on Stockpile, the Slug can even take some grass type attacks.
Even without Sp.Atk investment, Gastrodon still hits quite well, allowing it to two/three hit KO a lot of Pokémon, while threatening to status the ones it cannot take out fast. Scald lets it burn some threats it might not be able to defeat otherwise, Earth Power will drop Sp.Def to make sure even another wall isn't safe, Sludge Wave lets you spread poison while dealing damage and Clear Smog stops any attempt of a setup sweeper, that isn't a Steel type.

While 95 base attack isn't very high by modern standards Poliwrath makes up for it via very powerful attacks such as Surging Strikes and Close Combat. Jet Punch is also an extremely helpful offensive tool doing very solid damage with priority. Drain Punch also keeps Poliwrath healthy and synergizes excellently with Assault Vest. Ice Punch is a very solid coverage option to hit Dragons or Flying / Grass types in a pinch, and Flip Turn is an excellent tempo tool. Depending on your team composition Poliwrath can utilize a very useful water immunity in Water Absorb, or the powerful rain abusing Swift Swim to highten its offensive potential further.

Avalugg's sky high base 184 defense paired with a decent base 95 hp stat means that even physically offensive monsters like Mega-Lucario aren't able to knock it down after you set up a couple of Iron Defenses, essentially winning you the fight on the spot.

Unlike some other body press users Avalugg isnt completely helpless against Ghosts since its 4th slot can be used for coverage and even when uninvested that base 117 attack stat is nothing to scoff at.

The only threats to this build are special attackers given Avalugg's pitiful special defense, critical hits although to a lesser degree since you still have naturally high defense, and Unaware pokemon that can outstall you quite easily.

Most notably, being able to sit in front of Blue's Xerneas, Eternatus, and Walking Wake, Agatha's Yveltal, Lance's Arceus-Fairy, and Lorelei's Tapu Fini and Kyurem White.

Optionally, you could go Drain Punch over Ice Punch to regain some health, but this leaves you vulnerable to the likes of Mega Rayquaza, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. You can use Iron Hands to pick up a few extra kills if you have a strategy to deal with those three.

	comment = This is a very straightforward sweeping set. Similar to what you might use on Weavile or G-Darmanitan-Zen. A fast and powerful Ice-type is absolutely great against the E4, with the secondary typing deciding what other mons it can destroy besides a lot of what Lance would use, for example. As Chien Pao's a Dark-type, you have more coverage against Agatha's team. With its high Speed, it can outspeed most of the fastest mons the E4 has, only being outspeed by mons like Calyrex, Swift Swim Megs Swampert, and Primal Eternatus. You will mostly use Icicle Crash. Without doing calcs and just going by the move itself and the ability, which lowers the Defense of active mons that don't have Sword of Ruin by 25%, you are doing serious damage. Its SpDef isn't good, so you might not me able to take Draining Kiss from unboosted Calyrex. You could Scarf if you want, but it's better to have someone else take on Calyrex, while Chien Pao can at least mess up Yveltal. Chien Pao isn't ideal for Bruno, but for the other E4 members, it's a great mon to have. The moveset includes its best STAB options, coverage with Sacred Sword, and priority. Ice Shard could be for Primal Eternatus, I don't think I ever used Sucker Punch. You could risk taking Draco Barrage at full HP from Eternatus and retaliate with an OHKO Icicle Crash, but there's a good chance Draco Barrage will OHKO.

In conclusion, if you want a new kind of Weavile to play with, or in general, a new Ice-type sweeper, Chien Pao's highly recommended.

Relaxed Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Body Press  
- Will-O-Wisp  
- Flamethrower  
- Rest
    comment = Turtonator is an extremely useful mon in Hardcore mode. With an excellent defensive typing and access to one of the very few abilities that can increase a stat, Turtonator's 135 base Defense goes extremely far. Body Press will be your most commonly clicked move, as it demolishes most mons it's supereffective against and deals massive chip to anything else. Will-O-Wisp is great both for making your physical bulk even stronger and weakening a threat enough to allow another one of your mons to switch in and take it out safely. Plus, with the move never missing when the user is a fire type, you don't have to worry at all about a pesky 15% miss ruining your strategy. 
    Those two moves are staples of any Turt set, but the remaining two are quite flexible. Generally you'll want to prioritize a Fire STAB, but later in the game, Dragon types become quite common, so a Dragon STAB is occasionally preferred. Its signature move, Shell Trap, has a massive 150 base power and even hits both enemies in double battles, but it does require your opponent to target it with a physical move, which doesn't always happen. If that annoys you, I would run Flamethrower for consistency, but Overheat is also a great option. Since your primary move will be Body Press, you can click Overheat with little downside. Plus, Hardcore mode generally requires a lot of switching, so the penalty is negated even further. You could run both STABs, or even a coverage move like Scorching Sands if you want, but I like Rest as my fourth move. Rest is Turt's only recovery move, but it goes a long way. The most common killers of Turts are poison and frostbite, which Rest can heal. Additionally, this will come at little penalty with your phenomenal Defense stat if the physical mon stays in, or it causes the opponent to switch to a special attacking mon. While your SpDef is a solid 85, the 70 HP means that most special threats will take you out, unfortunately. However, if you properly predict the AI to switch, you can use that as a free opportunity to switch in your counter to it. 
    Long story short, Turt eats physical hits extremely well and supports its team members by burning physical threats and baiting switches. This guy is quite underrated for Hardcore mode, but he has been a crucial part of many of my runs.

Usually when Wobb is on the field its clicking Counter/Mirror Coat once or twice getting one or two KO's, then it dies. Sometimes an opposing Pokémon will use a setup move, in which case Wobbuffet can encore it then switch out. It can be a valuable bring to some fights throughout the game and is rarely dead weight on a team.

Generally you want to run Liechi Berry, however there is one exeption. On the Koga fight specifically you should run Salac Berry to outspeed Mega Toxtricity. If Hitmonlee isn't able to sweep entire fights then it usually still kills multiple Pokémon. 

To set up the sweep, you want to use endure, then get knocked down to 1 HP. This will activate your berry, in turn activating your Unburden ability, and it will make your Reversals have 200 base power. This allows you to outspeed and OHKO so much of the game, and is available right before Koga.

Giving it a Choice Scarf let's it outspeed most of the Elite 4 while as giving it a focus sash let's you freely switch up moves and always get a spike up.

Running Dragon Tail with a Focus Sash allows it to phase out Pokemon that setup in front of it while still being able to survive a hit while the sash is intact.

Finally, Aqua Jet or Sucker Punch can be utilized as a last ditch effort to chip your opponent before Samurott is taken out.

Adamant Nature
- Rock Blast
- Pounce
- Bulldoze
- Stone Axe
    comment = Kleavor was a very solid mon in HC Mode because of its typing and incredible Technician ability, though Sharpness (Blademaster pre 4.0) is another great ability. Thanks to the buff to Stone Axe and Ceaseless Edge being allowed in HC Mode, where hazards are set up (Stealth Rock from Stone Axe, Spikes from Ceaseless Edge), Kleavor's up a few notches. For me, Kleavor requires a lot of moveset changing, hence all the moves listed. Focusing on the E4, I set up Stone Axe on the last 3 E4 battles. You might be able to pull it off in the Lorelei and Bruno battles, but I consistently got it off in the last 3 battles. Rock Blast might not even be necessary, which does allow for more customization (Rock Blast is a tutor move and can't be relearned between E4 battles). I prefer Technician, so all the offensive moves, except for Stone Axe, capitalize on it. Defog is necessary to remove Infernape's Stealth Rock in the Bruno battle. This means Kleavor leads. I had it lead in all but the Lorelei battle. 

Against Agatha, Krook went for Stone Edge after the White Herb proc. Agatha's basically the best trainer to set up rocks on. Pounce is boosted by Technician and can lower Speed. You can lead with that and then KO Krookodile with Stone Axe, you may have to use Defog between those 2 hits. As for Lance, I was reckless and led with Kleavor to set up rocks and hopefully mess with Arceus-Fairy. Glimmora makes this a hassle because you WILL proc Toxic Debris. I'm sure there's a better strategy where you can prevent Glimmora's Toxic Debris to proc, and then set up Stealth Rock later at some point. With Kleavor as my lead, it's a 2HKO to Glimmora with Bulldoze and Stone Axe, resulting in 2 layers of Toxic Spikes. Kleavor has the Sash for Lance and Blue. This requires the AI to make the beneficial 50/50 choice for Arceus-Fairy. It often goes for Dialga unfortunately. The idea is Arceus would set up Calm Mind since Kleavor has the Sash and the AI's greedy when it comes to Sturdy and Sash users. After the Calm Mind, you can use Rock Blast once or twice and KO with Accelerock, hoping Arceus goes for a 2nd Calm Mind. Dialga always comes out after Arceus-Fairy's KO'd. This can allow you some Bulldoze hits and benefit a teammate in outspeeding Dialga.

Against Blue's rain teams, the Sash stays. You take Liquidation, retaliate with Pounce, and then set up with Stone Axe. Kyogre survives unfortunately, but it should be at around or even below 30% after those hits. A teammate can finish that beast off. Against Blue's sun team, the Sash is still there, and it really depends on the AI's choices. Defog and Bulldoze would have to be in the set, no Pounce. You could use Bulldoze, Defog, but one thing you will almost always use is Stone Axe. The sun team hates Stealth Rock the most, so while leading Kleavor against the rain teams is madness, especially if you want the Sash on someone else, in the sun team, I think it's more invaluable. 

In general, version 4.0 puts a lot more importance on Kleavor and H-Samurott, use them once and you might appreciate how helpful they are in this new era of Radical Red.

Because Wish heals 50% of the user's HP stat, it can use Wish, switch out, and heal the incoming Pokémon for a large portion of their HP. This makes it a good support Pokémon on some teams.
Apart from HP, Wigglytuff is very mediocre stat-wise. However, it has a good ability in Sheer Force, and many moves boosted by it. It has good STABs in Tri Attack and Moonblast along with tons of coverage.

    name = Bob Ross Who?
    item = White Herb / Choice Band
    ability = Unburden / Poison Touch
    nature = Adamant
    moves = Gunk Shot, Double-Edge, Low Kick, V-Create / Draco Barrage / Fishous Rend / Triple Arrows
	paste = Bob Ross Who? (Grafaiai) @ White Herb
Ability: Unburden
Adamant Nature
- Gunk Shot
- Double-Edge
- V-create
- Low Kick
    comment = Grafaiai can now learn Sketch, and despite only being able to learn one, Grafaiai has quickly moved to the top of the versaitility ranking. Grafaiai, unlike Smeargle, has a decent Speed Stat and enough attack to dish out moves like V-Create, Barrage and Fishous Rend. Depending on what your team requires the most, Grafaiai can always be the missing element to your team. 

V-Create is the best move for Grafaiai to hit Steel Types. When combined with a White Herb, it outspeeds everything in the game with Unburden, subsequently allowing it to attack everything else with Double-Edge, Gunk Shot, and Low Kick exclusively for Rock Types.

Draco Barrage allows you to kill all of the Elite 4's powerful dragon types while not having to worry about Fairy's as you're locked into Choice Band.

Fishous Rend and Choice Band paired with it's excellent speed allows you to deal Scarfed Vish like damage. If your team is lacking a water type Fishous Rend could be a go to.

Grafaiai may Flinch, Defense Drop, or Poison it's opponent all at once with Triple Arrows and Poison Touch. If you choose Triple Arrows with Sketch, Low Kick should be substituted with Parting Shot.

    item = Leftovers
    ability = Competitive
    evs = 252, 0, 0, 252, 4, 0 // HP, Atk, Def, Sp.Atk, Sp.Def, Speed
    nature = Modest
    moves = Make It Rain, Scald, Ice Beam, Roost
	paste = Offensive (Empoleon) @ Leftovers
Ability: Competitive
EVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD
Modest Nature
- Make It Rain
- Scald
- Ice Beam

    comment = Special Empoleon with Competitive is a powerful force who can do a great deal of damage. It is best used as a mid game wallbreaker that could also pose danger in the late game thanks to its ability to increase its Special Attack when it's stats get dropped, and its covering techniques make sure it can efficiently deal with a variety of opponents. Empoleon is very versatile thanks to this moveset, which concentrates on STAB moves and strong coverage while also offering recovery via Roost. Empoleon receiving Make It Rain in 4.0 makes it even more powerful than previous versions, which relied on Flash Cannon and missed opportunities to OHKO, which it can now achieve.

Meowscarada

    item = Life Orb / Sitrus Berry / Assault Vest / Choice Scarf
    ability = Protean
    nature = Jolly
    moves = Flower Trick, Sucker Punch (Shadow Claw for Agatha), any combination of Knock Off/Play Rough/Triple Axel
	paste = Classy Cat (Meowscarada) @ Life Orb
Ability: Protean
Jolly Nature
- Flower Trick
- Shadow Claw
- Knock Off
- Triple Axel
    comment = Thanks to its excellent speed, solid attack, amazing movepool and the Protean ability, Meowscarada may very well be the best Grass starter that isn’t Mega Sceptile. Protean allows Meowscarada to be an incredibly versatile attacker that can switch its type to give STAB on any of its attacking moves, while also changing out what would have been one of its weaknesses into a neutral or even resisted type. While expecting Meowscarada to sweep entire boss battles is unrealistic, Meowscarada is absolutely capable of destroying or severely weakening 1-2 key threats in boss battles if used correctly. Life Orb is generally the preferred item to maximize damage without locking into one move and ruining the point of Protean, but there are cases where Sitrus Berry is preferable for survivability. In terms of the Hardcore E4, Meowscarda is capable of destroying Mega Swamperts, Dragonites, Hail Lorelei’s Tapu Fini, Bruno’s Mega Medicham (can also do heavy damage to Necrozma Duskmane), Agatha’s Yveltal (with Triple Axel Life Orb) or Calyrex Shadow (with Choice Scarf), Lance’s Mega Rayquaza (with Triple Axel Life Orb), Champ’s Primal Kyogre, Ultra Necrozma, and Arceus Ground. It is also able to troll Primal Dialga and severely weaken it by switching to Play Rough and then switching back to a Dark type move to make sure it doesn’t get one-shot by Flash Cannon, but if you want to use Meowscarada for this purpose a Sitrus Berry is likely preferable for survivability. Overall, Meowscarda is an incredible offensive mon if used correctly that other Grass starters could only wish they could match.

Modest Nature
IVs: 0 Atk
- Tail Glow
- Thunderbolt
- Focus Blast
- Dragon Pulse
    comment = While mega ampharos is a very slow pokemon, it is quite powerful with its base 165 spatk. Despite it's good bulk, it has a hard time setting up and appreciates support from grassy terrain and Screens. Alternatively it can be used as a trick room sweeper.
Ampharos appreciates help from teammates like Rillaboom, Klefki, Grimmsnarl, Porygon2 and Hatterene as they provide Grassy terrain, Dual screens, and trick room support for Ampharos. While setting up with Mega Ampharos is quite difficult, it's immense power makes it worth it.

	paste = It's Filletin Time (Veluza) @ Scope Lens
Ability: Sharpness
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
Jolly Nature
- Psycho Cut
- Night Slash
- Aqua Cutter
- Fillet Away
    comment = At first glance it looks weak, but once you use Fillet Away at the right moment, this Pokemon turns into a sweep machine that can literally destroy any trainer in its path. Boosted cutting moves, critical hits and raising all offensive stats plays a significant role, especially if you can apply fish with Scope Lens, which will destroy even the thickest Pokemon with juicy critical hits (hi, Lance's Dialga). Sticky Web would be a good help for this fish, since there are still Pokemon that can be much faster. You also need to remember that Veluza does not have the best defense stats, though, you can work with them. So it is more recommended to use Sitrus Berry so that you have more chances to survive.

	paste = Draining Kiss (Comfey) @ Pixie Plate
Ability: Triage
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA
Modest Nature
- Draining Kiss
- Sparkly Swirl
- Giga Drain
- Leech Seed
    comment = Draining Kiss in combination with Triage is one of the most spammable attacks in the entire game. Comfey's utilizes it's low HP stat and its high defensive stats to consistently stay healthy with Draining Kiss' recovery using the priority of Triage to ensure you are always healthy before the opponent attacks. Calm Mind works wonderfully as it can increase the damage of Draining Kiss as well as provide extra survivability. Giga Drain is nice coverage for Water, Ground, and Rock types that also benefits from Triage's priority. Sparkly Swirl is a good for situations when you need to hit harder as well as providing valuable team support by clearing all status ailments on your team. Leech Seed is always a powerful defensive tool to provide valuable chip damage to anything Comfey can't damage very well, or it could utilize Synthesis to ensure it stays healthy. Since Draining Kiss is Comfey's main selling point you want to boost it's power as much as possible. Choice Specs is a very significant boost in power, while Pixie Plate is a good option if you want to keep the rest of your moveset readily available.

Ability: Mega Launcher
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
Modest Nature
- Shell Smash
- Water Pulse
- Ice Beam
- Aura Sphere
    comment = Mega Blastoise is 135 base Sp.Atk, 78 base Speed pokémon that can use Shell Smash to boost it's sweeping capacity much, much more.
But for setting up Shell Smash, you have to survive a hit, in order to do that you're gonna have to set up against a pokémon that's (before the set-up) faster than you, so they hit you before your defenses weaken.
Modest nature, as, after 2x speed, it can even outspeed Deoxys-Speed. Water Pulse is the option for most damage, and scald for the chance of burning physical attacker that may live scald (and also break Focus Sashes).
